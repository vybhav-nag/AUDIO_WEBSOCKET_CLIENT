## FAQ / Errors Solution
1. Mic is not working ? - Make sure Driver Bit rate, Sample Rate, Audio channel, Audio communication format are correct, and Pin is properly connected and configured
2. Speaker is not working ? - Make sure Driver Bit rate, Sample Rate, Audio channel, Audio communication format are correct, and Pin is properly connected and configured
3. Mic and Speaker are not working simultaneously - Make sure both devices have same I2S configuration [Hardware issue]
4. Websocket connect fail - make sure TLS is enabled in "menuconfig" and allow Allow "potentially insecure options" and "Skip server certificate verification by default (WARNING: ONLY FOR TESTING PURPOSE, READ HELP)"
5. Device crashing on recieving audio from server / not playing audio - make sure audio sent is in 2048 sample chunks and audio format is same as supported by speaker and I2S driver.
